## Plugins

Flight is currently extended with the following plugins.
In order to load your own written plugins,  implement IDetector.cs interface 
upload your own dll at runtime via "Upload you own DLL detector" option.
for more information look source code .


| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| AnomalyDetectionDll |https://github.com/DanielDayan/FlightSimulator_Project/FlightSim/Plugins/README.md |
| OxyPlot | https://github.com/oxyplot/oxyplot/blob/develop/README.md


## Development

Want to write your own DLL detector ? 

Implement IDetector interface that has the method : 

First Tab:

```sh
LearnNormal(string csv_path)
Detect(string csv_path)
GetAnomlySize(); 
AnomalyReport GetAnomalyByIndex(int idx)
```
Store your anomlies detected with a class / struct called AnomalyReport that has fields :
```sh
Second Tab:
Desc
Start
End
```
